Reactive Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume? It‚Äôs as easy as editing 3 values and you‚Äôre done. You don‚Äôt need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.

‚ùóÔ∏è Important Notice
Due to increasing and recurring costs from Google Cloud, I would have to take down the Version 1 and Version 2 editions of the application that live on https://v1.rxresu.me/ and https://v2.rxresu.me/ respectively.

I plan to take down the servers on 1st September 2023, so if you have any data on the earlier versions, please migrate it over to the latest version on https://rxresu.me/ as soon as you can.

The current version will remain unchanged, and is still actively supported. It will have no effect on these changes.

Thank you to the 400,000+ people using the app! üôè
